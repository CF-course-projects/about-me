    <p>Hello and welcome to my About Me page! Here I'll let you get to know me as a person where I'll share my background and interests. I was born to a Thai mother and an Italian father, and raised in New York City where I currently live. To date, I have lived in three countries on three different continents: The United States, Italy, and Thailand. I speak English abd Italian fluently and have intermediate French, Spanish and basic Thai proficiency. In college I studied languages with a focus in corporate communication, a sort of amalgam of marketing, management and public relations. After graduating I began to look into pivoting into software engineering thanks to a friend raving about the opportunity in the field and thus began my journey with Code Fellows. Working towards my future career in tech, my goal is to learn as much as I possibly can while also deepening my passion and hunger to create cool things that hopefully work as intended!</p>
